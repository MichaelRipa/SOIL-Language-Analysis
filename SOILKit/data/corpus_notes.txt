For Gutenburg books in different languages, the content lies between the following two lines:

*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DOPO IL DIVORZIO ***
*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DOPO IL DIVORZIO ***

For the sake of making corpuses, a current plan is to create a shellscript (or python script) that removes content outside of these lines.
